This report was an assignment for the Advanced Topics in Computer Science exam (2018), Master's Degree in Computer Science, University of Padova.

The document describes my experience while designing and programming a basic application with Obliv-C, a C language library for secure computation. I implemented an algorithm for comparing celestial bodies similarity, while solving restrictions on allowed operations such as the impossibility of performing, through the library math.h, the sqrt(float) operation.

To compile and try yourself the code, please refer to Obliv-C and the report.
